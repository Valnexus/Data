In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

I have used:
1) Highcharts for the Company Chart page
2) Axios for fetching data from the iexcloud API
3) Antd for the UI interface
4) React Router for routing
5) Redux for State managment

I did not use SASS or LESS because there was nothing to style thanks to Antd UI package.
